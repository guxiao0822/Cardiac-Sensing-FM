# 💓 Cardiac Sensing FM: A Multi-Modal Foundation Model for Cardiac Sensing Biosignals

**CSFM** is a large-scale, multi-modal foundation model developed for decoding cardiac sensing biosignals such as ECG and PPG. Trained with self-supervised learning on data from **1.7 million individuals**, it captures rich physiological patterns and can be applied to a wide range of downstream healthcare tasks.

### 🔍 Key Features

- 🧠 **Multi-modal input support** — Integrates ECG, PPG, and textual reports
- 🔬 **Self-supervised pretraining** — Scales across diverse, heterogeneous cardiac datasets
- 📊 **Massive training corpus** — Pretrained on biosignals from 1.7 million individuals
- 🏥 **Broad applications** — Enables:
  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification  
  - Demographic recognition 
  - Vital sign measurement
  - ECG-based question answering
  - Clinical outcome prediction
  - Cross-modality generation (e.g., wearable → 12-lead ECG, PPG → ECG)
  - ...

## 📈 Quickstart: Using Cardiac-Sensing-FM as a Feature Extractor

Use `CSFM` directly as a feature extractor to generate meaningful representations from raw biosignals.

### 🔹 Download the Pretrained Model Weights
Download the pretrained weights from the provided shared link 

> The CSFM pretrained weights are available to academic researchers under a signed Academic Access Agreement.
>
> To request access, please email **xiao.gu@eng.ox.ac.uk** from your institutional email address with the required subject line:
>
> **CSFM Weights Request – [Full Name] – [Institution]**
>

### 🔹 Load the Pretrained Model

```python
from network.model import CSFM_model
import torch 

# initialize the model with optional size: 'Tiny', 'Base', 'Large' 
model = CSFM_model('Tiny') 

model = model.cuda()
model.eval()

# Load pretrained weights if available
checkpoint_path = 'pretrained/<checkpoint_file>.pth'
print('load from ', checkpoint_path)
checkpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path)
encoder_state_dict = {k.replace('encoder.', ''): v for k, v in checkpoint.items() if k.startswith('encoder.') and 'mlp_head' not in k}

model.load_state_dict(encoder_state_dict, strict=False)

```

### 🔹 Extract Features from a Biosignal

To extract features, you need to provide:
1. A **preprocessed biosignal** (e.g., Any-channel ECG and/or PPG), formatted as a NumPy array, shape : `[channels, time]`  
2. The **input channels**, which specify the type of signal:
   - `0–11`: Standard 12-lead ECG {I, II, III, AVR, AVL, AVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6}
   - `12`: PPG
   - Wearable ECG treated as lead II, i.e., use channel = `1`

### examples of preprocessing a Lead II ECG + PPG
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from utils import preprocess_ecg, preprocess_ppg

# Load and preprocess
ecg = ...  # shape: (1, time)
ppg = ...  # shape: (1, time)
ecg_fs, ppg_fs = 100, 100

# Clean. Normalize and Standard
ecg = preprocess_ecg(ecg, ecg_fs) 
ppg = preprocess_ppg(ppg, ppg_fs)

# Concatenate signals (channels x time)
signal = np.concatenate((ecg, ppg), axis=0) 

# Channel Settings
channels = np.asarray([1, 12])  # ECG lead II + PPG

# Disable classification head
model.mlp_head = nn.Identity()

# Extract features
features = model(torch.tensor(signal).unsqueeze(0), channels)  # shape: (1, hidden_dim)
```

You can then use `features` for tasks such as clustering, retrieval, or downstream model training.
